# Summary
Titanic was biggest ship of its time, a engineering marvel that sank on its first voyage. Many passengers perished in this tragedy. In the attached visualization, patterns for survived passengers are depicted where we see that survival chances of passengers were highest if they belong to high class compartment or they were female.  

# Design
* We used vertically stacked bar chart as visual elements to show count of passengers with respect to a particular category.
* We used color coding to differentiate between survived and unsurvived passengers.
* We first give summary visualization of survived/unsurvived passengers and then give interaction buttons to look into granular visualization.

# Feedback
1) A description was missing, which left user confused and reader could not make a story.  
2) Interaction was missing in visualization.  
3) There was error in survival and non-survival numbers as they were interchanged due to bug.
