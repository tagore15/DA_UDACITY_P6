# Summary
Titanic was biggest ship of its time, a engineering marvel that sank on its first voyage. Many passengers perished in this tragedy. In the attached visualization, patterns for survived passengers are depicted where we see that survival chances of passengers were highest if they belong to high class compartment or they were female.
# Design
* We used vertically stacked bar chart as visual elements to show count of passengers with respect to a particular category.
* We used color coding to differentiate between survived and unsurvived passengers.
* To make story iterative, we first showed relation between Gender and survival rate. Secondly we showed relation between Class and surival rate. Finally a combined relationship was shown as a group bar chart.
